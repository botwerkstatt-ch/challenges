**Problem**
Imagine facing a legal issue, but everything feels unclear. Emotionally caught up, all you want is to be right â€“ but you have no idea if itâ€™s even worth pursuing. Most people donâ€™t know how much time and money such a process will cost. They have no clear idea of their chances of winning. Instead, they face uncertainty and frustration when making decisions.



**Objective**
Your solution aims to help individuals understand what they are getting into by providing a clear overview of their legal situation. The solution should display the following features:

- Likelihood of winning the case
- Cost range (estimated financial effort)
- Timeframe until the case is resolved

The goal is to give users a straightforward, transparent view of their potential legal journey, so they can make informed decisions about whether to proceed.
